# HPA-Theta-hybrid-optimised-pathfinding-system-in-Unity-DOTS-stack.

UNITY 2019.3.2f1

Requires: Burst, Jobs, Entities, Mathematics, HybridRenderer, UnityCollections.

This is a simple Unity Scene where you can easily make a grid with obstacles and test out pathfidning. It is multi-threaded and BURSTCOMPILED so it is very fast.

The visual aid was taken out, only the scripts remain, will fix when I can.. sorry
